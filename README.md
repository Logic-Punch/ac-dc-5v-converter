## ac-dc-5v-converter

This repository contains the design files and Bill of Materials (BOM) for a simple AC-DC converter that takes a mains input of 100-240VAC and converts it to a stable 5VDC at 1 Amp. The design includes mounting holes for easy integration into your project. This is a **2 layer PCB**.

### Features

* Input voltage: 100-240VAC
* Output voltage: 5VDC
* Output current: 1 Amp
* Mounting holes for easy integration
* 2 Layer PCB

### License

This project is licensed under the CERN Open Hardware Licence Version 2 - Permissive. See the [LICENSE](LICENSE) file for details.

### Bill of Materials (BOM)

The Bill of Materials (BOM) is provided in two formats for your convenience:

* **[BOM.md](BOM.md):** This file provides a human-readable markdown format of the BOM.
* **BOM.csv:** This file is a comma-separated values file that can be easily imported into various tools and software.

Both files are included in the [Release 1.00](https://github.com/logic-punch/ac-dc-5v-converter/releases/tag/v1.00).

### Design Files

The design files for this project are provided in the following formats:

* **KiCad project files (Optional):**
    * [schematic](schematic): Contains the schematic diagram for the converter circuit.
    * [pcb](pcb): Contains the PCB layout files.
* **Gerber files (in release 1.00):**
    * Download the gerber files from the [Release 1.00](https://github.com/logic-punch/ac-dc-5v-converter/releases/tag/v1.00) folder. These files can be used by a PCB fabrication service to manufacture the PCB.

### Building the Project

**Using KiCad (Optional):**

If you are familiar with KiCad and want to edit the design, you can download the KiCad project files and open them in KiCad.

**Using Gerbers:**

The Gerbers are the most common way to have a PCB manufactured by a professional service. Download the gerber files from the release tag and send them to a PCB fabrication service for manufacturing. 

**Note:** Make sure you have obtained all the components listed in the BOM before proceeding with assembly.
